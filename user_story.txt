The key elements of a comprehensive BGP status dashboard should include:

BGP Peer Status:
Display the status of all BGP peers (Up, Down, Idle, etc.)
Indicate the peer IP address, AS number, and session state
Provide historical uptime and downtime statistics for each peer

Prefix Routing Information:
Show the number of prefixes received from each BGP peer
Highlight any changes in the number of received prefixes over time
Detect and display any prefix withdrawal or flapping events

Route Convergence Monitoring:
Track the time it takes for BGP updates to propagate through the network
Measure the convergence time for route updates and changes
Identify any slow or delayed route convergence events

BGP Session Metrics:
Display key session metrics such as open/close rate, TCP retransmissions, and session resets
Analyze trends and anomalies in these metrics to detect potential issues

Alerting and Notification System:
Set up configurable thresholds and triggers for alerts
Notify administrators of critical events, such as peer flapping, prefix withdrawals, or route convergence issues
Provide a centralized view of all active and historical alerts

Network Topology Visualization:
Graphically represent the BGP peering relationships and autonomous system (AS) topology
Highlight problematic BGP links or peers within the network topology

Reporting and Analytics:
Generate reports on BGP performance, trends, and historical data
Provide detailed analysis and insights to aid in network troubleshooting and optimization

A Real time BGP Dashboard can make it simple to eliminate BGP as the route casue of the issue.

To implement this BGP status dashboard, you could use a combination of network monitoring tools, 
such as Cacti, Zabbix, or Grafana, along with custom scripts or integrations to collect and visualize the relevant BGP data.
